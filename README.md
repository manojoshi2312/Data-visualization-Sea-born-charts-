📊 Python Data Analytics Assignment 2 – Data Visualization

This project focuses on exploring and visualizing the Taxis dataset using Python libraries such as Matplotlib, Pandas, and Seaborn.

🧩 Key Tasks

Loaded and cleaned the Taxis dataset using Seaborn.

Handled missing values with suitable imputation or removal strategies.

📈 Visualizations Created

Using Matplotlib / Pandas Plot:

Line Chart: Fare over time (pickup vs. fare).

Bar Chart: Total fare by pickup borough.

Pie Chart: Distribution of trips by payment method.

Histogram: Distribution of trip distances.

Box Plot: Tip amounts by pickup borough.

Using Seaborn:

Count Plot: Number of trips per borough.

Scatter Plot: Relationship between distance and fare.

Heatmap: Correlation between numerical variables (distance, fare, tip, tolls, total).

Pair Plot: Pairwise relationships between distance, fare, tip, and total.

Violin Plot: Fare distribution by payment method.
